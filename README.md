## Project Name: SPACE TUBE (A Space Farming Solution)

#### _Keywords: space tube, tube app, artificial intelligence, fertilization, astronauts, image processing, autonomous system._

## Space Tube 
Space tube is a tube where essential crops will be produced in space with the help of scientific method and the project is based on a mobile app. In this tube, the cultivation process, supplying nutrition will be processed autonomously. All of the information and data of this tube will be stored in ‘ Tube App'. 

## Fertilization 
For the optimum growth of crops, A spray system will provide necessary amount of fertilizers and pesticides. An optimum amount of fertilizers and pesticides will be reserved and the autonomous system of the space tube will give command to apply  those components. 

## Watering 
The autonomous system of the space tube will give command at certain period of time to provide the necessary amount of water. Water will be supplied to the plants after the command.

## Waste management   
The surplus amount of fertilizers and pesticides will be automatically recycled and it will pass by a purification tube and finally it will come to the general tube and will be used further.

## Artificial light 
For the growth of seedlings artificial light will be used alternative to sunlight as there has a scarcity necessary amount of sunlight for growing crops. Artificial light will contain fluorescent light and ultraviolet light. Real Time Navigator will turn on the lights at a certain period of time to control photosynthesis rate.

## Oxygen and Carbon di-oxide balance
A sensor of space tube autonomous system will control the level of carbon dioxide and oxygen which is naturally needed for the harvest.

## Artificial Intelligence 
Growth of the plants, environment of the tube and the nutrition supply will be monitored by ‘Image Processing’ and ‘ Real Time Monitoring System'.

## Tube App
The app has been designed for controlling the hardware and it has it’s own data page. Astronauts can be acknowledged about the conditions of space tube and they can control the space tube specifications through the App. The app will store all the informations and data of the tube. The app will notify the astronauts about the stages of crops and when to reap the harvest.

Therefore, autonomous system of the space tube will control the entire environment of the tube ensure the  reaping of good harvest. It doesn’t need 24 hour human surveillance and the technology will ensure the nutritions  for the astronauts for a long period of time in space. This technology can be used in earth for the reaping of quality harvest as the optimum environment for the crop is maintained strictly.
